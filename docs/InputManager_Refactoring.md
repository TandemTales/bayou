# InputManager Refactoring

## Overview

This document describes the refactoring of input handling in the Bayou Bonanza client from a monolithic approach in `main.cpp` to a dedicated `InputManager` class, and its subsequent move from the shared GameLogic library to the client-specific code.

## Problem

The original `main.cpp` file was becoming quite large (428 lines) with significant input handling logic embedded directly in the main game loop. This made the code:

- Difficult to maintain and debug
- Hard to test input logic in isolation
- Challenging to extend with new input features
- Tightly coupled between input handling and main application logic

## Solution

Created a dedicated `InputManager` class that encapsulates all input-related functionality:

### Files Created

1. **`include/InputManager.h`** - Header file with class definition
2. **`src/InputManager.cpp`** - Implementation file with all input logic (client-specific)
3. **`tests/InputManagerTests.cpp`** - Unit tests for the InputManager (client-specific tests)

### Architectural Decision: Client vs Shared Library

**Initial Implementation**: InputManager was initially placed in the shared GameLogic library.

**Problem Identified**: This violated the separation of concerns principle because:
- InputManager depends on SFML Graphics (`sf::RenderWindow`, `sf::Event`)
- Server doesn't need input handling capabilities
- Client-specific UI concerns were mixed with shared game logic

**Final Implementation**: InputManager moved to client-specific code.

**Benefits of Client-Specific Placement**:
- ✅ **Clean Dependencies**: GameLogic library only depends on SFML Network
- ✅ **Server Independence**: Server doesn't link unnecessary graphics dependencies
- ✅ **Proper Separation**: UI/Input concerns separated from core game logic
- ✅ **Future Flexibility**: Different clients could implement different input schemes

### Key Features

#### InputManager Class Responsibilities

- **Event Handling**: Processes SFML mouse events (press, move, release)
- **Piece Selection**: Manages piece selection and deselection logic
- **Drag and Drop**: Handles piece dragging with proper mouse offset calculation
- **Move Validation**: Validates moves client-side before sending to server
- **Server Communication**: Sends valid moves to the game server
- **State Management**: Maintains input state (selected piece, coordinates, etc.)

#### Public Interface

```cpp
class InputManager {
public:
    // Constructor
    InputManager(sf::RenderWindow& window, sf::TcpSocket& socket,
                 GameState& gameState, bool& gameHasStarted, 
                 PlayerSide& myPlayerSide);

    // Main event handling
    bool handleEvent(const sf::Event& event);

    // State accessors
    std::shared_ptr<Piece> getSelectedPiece() const;
    bool isPieceSelected() const;
    sf::Vector2i getOriginalSquareCoords() const;
    sf::Vector2f getCurrentMousePosition() const;
    sf::Vector2f getMouseOffset() const;

    // State management
    void resetInputState();
};
```

#### Private Helper Methods

- `calculateBoardLayout()` - Computes board positioning and sizing
- `screenToBoard()` - Converts screen coordinates to board coordinates
- `handleMouseButtonPressed()` - Processes mouse press events
- `handleMouseMoved()` - Processes mouse movement events
- `handleMouseButtonReleased()` - Processes mouse release events
- `selectPiece()` - Handles piece selection logic
- `attemptMove()` - Validates and processes move attempts
- `sendMoveToServer()` - Sends moves to the game server

## Benefits

### Code Organization
- **Separation of Concerns**: Input logic is now isolated from main application flow
- **Single Responsibility**: InputManager has one clear purpose
- **Reduced Complexity**: Main.cpp is now ~200 lines shorter and more focused
- **Proper Architecture**: Client-specific code separated from shared game logic

### Maintainability
- **Easier Debugging**: Input issues can be isolated to the InputManager
- **Cleaner Code**: Related functionality is grouped together
- **Better Documentation**: Clear interface with documented methods
- **Cleaner Dependencies**: No graphics dependencies in server code

### Testability
- **Unit Testing**: Input logic can now be tested in isolation
- **Mock Support**: Can easily mock dependencies for testing
- **Regression Prevention**: Tests ensure input behavior remains consistent
- **Separate Test Suites**: Client and server logic tested independently

### Extensibility
- **New Features**: Easy to add new input types (keyboard, gamepad, etc.)
- **Configuration**: Input behavior can be made configurable
- **Customization**: Different input schemes can be implemented
- **Platform Independence**: Server can run headless, client handles all UI

## Implementation Details

### Board Layout Calculation

The InputManager calculates board positioning dynamically based on window size:

```cpp
void calculateBoardLayout(float& boardSize, float& squareSize, 
                         float& boardStartX, float& boardStartY) const {
    float windowWidth = static_cast<float>(window.getSize().x);
    float windowHeight = static_cast<float>(window.getSize().y);
    
    boardSize = std::min(windowWidth, windowHeight) * 0.8f;
    squareSize = boardSize / GameBoard::BOARD_SIZE;
    boardStartX = (windowWidth - boardSize) / 2.0f;
    boardStartY = (windowHeight - boardSize) / 2.0f;
}
```

### Coordinate Conversion

Screen coordinates are converted to board coordinates with bounds checking:

```cpp
sf::Vector2i screenToBoard(const sf::Vector2f& screenPos, 
                          float boardStartX, float boardStartY, 
                          float squareSize) const {
    int boardX = static_cast<int>((screenPos.x - boardStartX) / squareSize);
    int boardY = static_cast<int>((screenPos.y - boardStartY) / squareSize);
    
    if (boardX >= 0 && boardX < GameBoard::BOARD_SIZE && 
        boardY >= 0 && boardY < GameBoard::BOARD_SIZE) {
        return sf::Vector2i(boardX, boardY);
    }
    
    return sf::Vector2i(-1, -1); // Invalid position
}
```

### Move Validation and Server Communication

The InputManager validates moves client-side before sending to the server:

```cpp
void attemptMove(int targetX, int targetY) {
    Position targetPosition(targetX, targetY);
    
    if (selectedPiece && selectedPiece->getSide() == gameState.getActivePlayer() &&
        selectedPiece->isValidMove(gameState.getBoard(), targetPosition)) {
        
        Position startPosition(originalSquareCoords.x, originalSquareCoords.y);
        Move gameMove(selectedPiece, startPosition, targetPosition);
        
        if (gameHasStarted && myPlayerSide == gameState.getActivePlayer()) {
            sendMoveToServer(gameMove);
        }
    }
}
```

## Testing

The InputManager includes comprehensive unit tests covering:

- **Construction**: Verifies proper initialization
- **Initial State**: Ensures correct default state
- **State Reset**: Tests state clearing functionality
- **Event Handling**: Verifies proper event processing

### Test Results

## Integration

### Main.cpp Changes

The main.cpp file was significantly simplified:

**Before**: 428 lines with embedded input logic
**After**: ~300 lines with clean separation of concerns

Key changes:
- Removed all input handling variables and logic
- Added InputManager instantiation
- Replaced input event handling with single `inputManager.handleEvent(event)` call
- Updated rendering to use InputManager state accessors

### Build System

Updated `CMakeLists.txt` to include:
- Removed `src/InputManager.cpp` from GameLogic library sources
- Added `src/InputManager.cpp` to CLIENT_SOURCES
- Created separate `BayouBonanzaClientTests` executable for client-specific tests
- Maintained clean dependency separation:
  - GameLogic: `sfml-network sfml-system`
  - Client: `GameLogic sfml-graphics sfml-window`
  - Server: `GameLogic` (inherits network dependencies)

### Dependency Graph
