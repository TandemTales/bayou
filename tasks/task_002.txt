# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Core Game Engine and Board Representation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the foundational game engine with chess-like board representation and basic game state management.
# Details:
1. Define the game board as an 8x8 grid
2. Implement board representation using a 2D array or vector
3. Create enums for piece types, player sides, and square states
4. Implement basic game state class to track board state, active player, and game phase
5. Create methods for board initialization and reset

Pseudo-code for board representation:
```cpp
class GameBoard {
private:
    std::array<std::array<Square, 8>, 8> board;
    
public:
    GameBoard();
    Square& getSquare(int x, int y);
    bool isValidPosition(int x, int y) const;
    void resetBoard();
    // Additional methods for board manipulation
};

class Square {
private:
    Piece* piece; // nullptr if empty
    int controlValuePlayer1;
    int controlValuePlayer2;
    
public:
    Square();
    bool isEmpty() const;
    Piece* getPiece() const;
    void setPiece(Piece* piece);
    int getControlValue(PlayerSide side) const;
    void setControlValue(PlayerSide side, int value);
};
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for board initialization and reset
2. Verify correct dimensions and indexing of the board
3. Test boundary conditions for board access
4. Validate game state transitions
5. Ensure proper tracking of board state

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Board Representation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a data structure to represent the game board
### Details:
Implement a 2D array or matrix to represent the game board. Define methods for accessing and modifying board cells.

## 2. Implement Game State Class [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create a class to manage the overall game state
### Details:
Design a GameState class that includes the board, current player, score, and other relevant game information. Implement methods for updating and querying the game state.

## 3. Develop Move Validation Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Implement logic to validate player moves
### Details:
Create methods to check if a move is legal based on the current game state and board configuration. Include checks for piece placement, capture rules, and any special move conditions.

## 4. Implement Move Execution [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3
### Description: Create methods to execute valid moves and update the game state
### Details:
Develop functions to apply a validated move to the game state, updating the board, player turns, and any other affected game elements.

## 5. Design Game Rules Engine [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Implement the core game rules and logic
### Details:
Create a Rules class that encapsulates the game's rules, including win conditions, draw conditions, and any special game mechanics.

## 6. Implement Turn Management [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.4, 2.5
### Description: Create a system to manage player turns and game flow
### Details:
Develop methods to handle turn transitions, including any special actions that occur at the beginning or end of a turn.

## 7. Create Game Initialization Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Implement methods to set up a new game
### Details:
Develop functions to initialize the game board, set up initial piece positions, and establish the starting game state.

## 8. Implement Game Over Detection [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.5
### Description: Create logic to detect when the game has ended
### Details:
Develop methods to check for win conditions, draw conditions, or any other game-ending scenarios after each move or turn.
