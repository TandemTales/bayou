# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Core Game Engine and Board Representation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the foundational game engine with chess-like board representation and basic game state management.
# Details:
1. Define the game board as an 8x8 grid
2. Implement board representation using a 2D array or vector
3. Create enums for piece types, player sides, and square states
4. Implement basic game state class to track board state, active player, and game phase
5. Create methods for board initialization and reset

Pseudo-code for board representation:
```cpp
class GameBoard {
private:
    std::array<std::array<Square, 8>, 8> board;
    
public:
    GameBoard();
    Square& getSquare(int x, int y);
    bool isValidPosition(int x, int y) const;
    void resetBoard();
    // Additional methods for board manipulation
};

class Square {
private:
    Piece* piece; // nullptr if empty
    int controlValuePlayer1;
    int controlValuePlayer2;
    
public:
    Square();
    bool isEmpty() const;
    Piece* getPiece() const;
    void setPiece(Piece* piece);
    int getControlValue(PlayerSide side) const;
    void setControlValue(PlayerSide side, int value);
};
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for board initialization and reset
2. Verify correct dimensions and indexing of the board
3. Test boundary conditions for board access
4. Validate game state transitions
5. Ensure proper tracking of board state
