# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup C++20 Project with CMake and SFML
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with C++20, CMake build system, and SFML integration for graphics and input handling.
# Details:
1. Create a new C++ project with CMake
2. Configure CMake to use C++20 standard
3. Integrate SFML library for graphics and input handling
4. Setup basic project structure with directories for source, headers, assets, and tests
5. Create a simple window application to verify SFML integration
6. Setup Git repository with appropriate .gitignore

CMakeLists.txt example:
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
project(BayouBonanza VERSION 0.1.0)

# C++20 standard
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

# Find SFML packages
find_package(SFML 2.5 COMPONENTS graphics window system REQUIRED)

# Include directories
include_directories(include)

# Add executable
add_executable(BayouBonanza src/main.cpp)

# Link libraries
target_link_libraries(BayouBonanza sfml-graphics sfml-window sfml-system)
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that the project builds successfully with CMake
2. Ensure SFML window opens and displays correctly
3. Confirm that input events are properly captured
4. Test on Windows platform to ensure compatibility

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install necessary tools [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install C++20 compatible compiler, CMake, and SFML library
### Details:
1. Install a C++20 compatible compiler (e.g., GCC 10+ or Clang 10+)
2. Install CMake (version 3.16 or higher)
3. Download and install SFML library (version 2.5.1 or higher)

## 2. Set up project directory structure [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create the basic directory structure for the C++20 project
### Details:
1. Create a root project directory
2. Create subdirectories: 'src' for source files, 'include' for header files, 'lib' for libraries, and 'build' for CMake output

## 3. Configure CMakeLists.txt [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Create and configure the main CMakeLists.txt file for the project
### Details:
1. Set minimum CMake version
2. Define project name and language
3. Set C++ standard to C++20
4. Add SFML dependency
5. Set include directories
6. Add executable and link libraries

## 4. Create initial C++ source files [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Set up basic C++ source files for the project
### Details:
1. Create a main.cpp file in the 'src' directory
2. Implement a basic SFML window creation in main.cpp
3. Create additional header files in 'include' directory if needed

## 5. Generate build files [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Use CMake to generate build files for the project
### Details:
1. Navigate to the 'build' directory
2. Run CMake command to generate build files
3. Verify that build files are created successfully

## 6. Build and run the project [done]
### Dependencies: 1.5
### Description: Compile the project and run the executable
### Details:
1. Use generated build files to compile the project
2. Locate the compiled executable
3. Run the executable and verify SFML window appears
4. Test for any runtime errors or issues
