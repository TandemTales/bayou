# Bayou Bonanza - Complete Gameplay Loop Implementation

## Overview

The complete gameplay loop has been successfully implemented, providing a fully functional client-server chess-like game with real-time multiplayer capabilities.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Server-Side Game Logic

**Move Processing Pipeline:**
- **Move Reconstruction**: Server reconstructs complete Move objects with piece references from client data
- **Validation**: Multi-layer validation including turn verification, piece ownership, and move legality
- **Execution**: Proper move execution with combat resolution and board state updates
- **Broadcasting**: Automatic game state synchronization to all connected clients

**Game Components:**
- `TurnManager`: Manages game flow, turn switching, and action processing
- `GameRules`: Enforces game rules, win conditions, and piece placement
- `MoveExecutor`: Handles move validation, execution, and combat resolution
- `GameState`: Maintains authoritative game state with serialization support

### 2. Enhanced Game Setup

**Complete Piece Set:**
- Kings, Queens, Rooks, Bishops, Knights, Pawns
- Standard chess-like starting formation
- Proper piece positioning for both players

**Game Mechanics:**
- Board control calculation and visualization
- Steam generation based on controlled squares
- Turn-based gameplay with proper player switching
- Win condition detection (King capture)

### 3. Client-Server Architecture

**Network Protocol:**
- Message-based communication using SFML packets
- Structured message types for different game events
- Reliable TCP connection with proper error handling

**Client Features:**
- Drag-and-drop piece movement with visual feedback
- Real-time game state updates from server
- Move validation feedback and rejection handling
- Player assignment and turn indicators

**Server Features:**
- Multi-client connection management
- Game initialization when both players connect
- Authoritative move validation and processing
- Automatic game state broadcasting

### 4. Flow of Control

**Complete Move Flow:**
1. **Client Input**: Mouse drag-and-drop piece selection and movement
2. **Client Validation**: Basic validation before sending to server
3. **Network Transmission**: Serialized move data sent via TCP
4. **Server Reception**: Move deserialization and reconstruction
5. **Server Validation**: Comprehensive validation (turn, ownership, legality)
6. **Move Execution**: Game state update with combat resolution
7. **State Broadcasting**: Updated game state sent to all clients
8. **Client Update**: Visual board update and turn switching

## Key Implementation Details

### Server-Side Move Processing

```cpp
// Move reconstruction with piece reference
Move reconstructMoveWithPiece(const Move& clientMove, const GameState& gameState) {
    const GameBoard& board = gameState.getBoard();
    const Position& from = clientMove.getFrom();
    
    const Square& fromSquare = board.getSquare(from.x, from.y);
    std::shared_ptr<Piece> piece = fromSquare.getPiece();
    
    return Move(piece, from, clientMove.getTo());
}

// Validation and processing pipeline
if (completeMove.getPiece()->getSide() != client->playerSide) {
    sendMoveRejection(client, "Cannot move opponent's piece");
    return;
}

turnManager->processMoveAction(completeMove, [&](const ActionResult& result) {
    if (result.success) {
        broadcastGameState(globalGameState);
    } else {
        sendMoveRejection(client, result.message);
    }
});
```

### Client-Side Input Handling

```cpp
// Drag-and-drop with validation
if (selectedPiece && selectedPiece->getSide() == gameState.getActivePlayer() &&
    selectedPiece->isValidMove(gameState.getBoard(), targetPosition)) {
    
    Move gameMove(selectedPiece, startPosition, targetPosition);
    
    if (gameHasStarted && myPlayerSide == gameState.getActivePlayer()) {
        sf::Packet movePacket;
        movePacket << MessageType::MoveToServer << gameMove;
        socket.send(movePacket);
    }
}
```

### Game State Synchronization

```cpp
// Server broadcasts to all clients
void broadcastGameState(const GameState& gameState) {
    sf::Packet updatePacket;
    updatePacket << MessageType::GameStateUpdate << gameState;
    
    for (auto& client : clients) {
        if (client->connected) {
            client->socket.send(updatePacket);
        }
    }
}

// Client receives and updates
case MessageType::GameStateUpdate:
    if (receivedPacket >> gameState) {
        // Visual board automatically updates
        printBoardState(gameState);
    }
```

## Build and Run Instructions

**Build:**
```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

**Quick Multiplayer Test (Windows):**
```bash
.\test_multiplayer.bat
```
This script automatically starts the server and both clients in the correct order.

**Manual Setup:**

1. **Start Server:**
```bash
.\build\Debug\BayouBonanzaServer.exe
```

2. **Start First Client (Player One):**
```bash
.\build\Debug\BayouBonanzaClient.exe
```
The first client will be assigned as Player One and will wait for the second player.

3. **Start Second Client (Player Two):**
```bash
.\build\Debug\BayouBonanzaClient.exe
```
The second client will be assigned as Player Two, and the game will automatically start.

**Run Standalone Tests:**
```bash
.\build\Debug\GameplayTest.exe
```

## Testing the Complete Multiplayer Experience

**Required Setup:**
- 1 Server instance
- 2 Client instances (both players required to start the game)

**Expected Flow:**
1. Server starts and listens on port 50000
2. First client connects → assigned Player One → waits for opponent
3. Second client connects → assigned Player Two → game starts immediately
4. Both clients receive initial game state with full chess board
5. Player One (blue pieces) can make the first move
6. Moves are validated by server and synchronized to both clients
7. Turn alternates between players until game ends (King capture)

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Authoritative Server**: Prevents cheating and ensures game state consistency
2. **Real-time Multiplayer**: Immediate move feedback and state synchronization
3. **Modular Design**: Clean separation between game logic, networking, and UI
4. **Extensible**: Easy to add new piece types, game modes, or features
5. **Robust Validation**: Multiple validation layers ensure game integrity

## Future Enhancements

- Spectator mode support
- Game replay functionality
- Advanced piece abilities and special moves
- Tournament and ranking systems
- Enhanced visual effects and animations

The implementation provides a solid foundation for a complete multiplayer strategy game with room for future expansion and enhancement.
